This script runs an algorithm based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, to ascertain likely lifetime diagnosis of specific phobia using the GLAD Study and COPING NIHR BioResource (NBR) data.

Algorithm developed for the paper "Comparison of algorithm-based versus single-item phenotyping measures of depression and anxiety disorders in the GLAD Study cohort" - Davies et al (in prep).

Full description of the algorithms and scripts written for the paper can be accessed at:

# DSM-5 Specific phobia diagnostic criteria

A.  Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood). 

B.  The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.

C.  The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.

D.  The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific objector situation and to the sociocultural context.

E.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.

F.   The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress* or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

G.  The  disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other  incapacitating  symptoms (as in agoraphobia): objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in sepÂ¬aration anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).*


*The questionnaire doesn't adequately measure significant distress or criterion G.

## Screening variables
The specific phobia section screening questions include:
1) At least one phobia (criterion A) must be endorsed
2) Frequency of these fears (criterion B) are almost always or always present when exposed to the phobia


*How the screening questions work*
If participants answer 'No' to all phobias in criterion A, then they are given a 0 for diagnosis and skip the remaining questions.

If participants answer 'Yes' to any phobia in criterion A but report frequency of these fears as "Never", "Only one or two times ever", or "Some of the time", then they are given a 0 for diagnosis and skip the remaining questions.


Criterion A. Calculate specific phobias count 'score' (the number of phobias endorsed)
```{r phobias count score screener}

#Do NOT use 'is.na' for these as then you cannot +1 to it. Use the no.info item for NA (below).

## Missingness

*Screening missingness variable:*
If participants do not respond to one of the screening questions, then they are not shown the remaining questions and should autmatically have "NA" as their score.

For criterion B, NA is only counted if criterion A is 1 (since otherwise the question was not displayed).

*Symptom missingness variable:*
Similarly, once participants pass the screeners, if any of the other core symptoms are NA then the participant might have received a diagnosis of specific phobia, but we won't know. 

Future considerations: If a participant has an NA in this score but was far from meeting diagnostic criteria, then we may still want to keep them as a '0' for diagnosis.
