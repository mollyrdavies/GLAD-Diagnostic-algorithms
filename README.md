# GLAD DIAGCOMP - comparing algorithm-based and single-item phenotyping measures of major depression and anxiety disorders

## Summary
Code repository for Davies et al (in prep) "Comparison of algorithm-based versus single-item phenotyping measures of depression and anxiety disorders in the GLAD Study cohort"

The project uses data from the Genetic links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, but can be applied to other datasets that include the CIDI and DSM-5 checklist questionnaires.

***Diagnostic algorithms***
These scripts contain algorithms for assessing likely lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of:
1) Major depressive disorder (MDD)
2) Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
3) Specific phobia
4) Social anxiety disorder/social phobia
5) Panic disorder
6) Agoraphobia


***Aim***
Assess the comparability of two commonly used phenotyping methods for depression and anxiety disorders.
