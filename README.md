# Comparing algorithm-based and single-item phenotyping measures of major depression and anxiety disorders

## Summary
Code repository for [Davies et al (2022) "Comparison of symptom-based versus self-reported diagnostic measures of anxiety and depression disorders in the GLAD and COPING cohorts"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102491)

The project uses data from the [Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study](https://gladstudy.org.uk/), but can be applied to other datasets that include the CIDI and DSM-5 checklist questionnaires.

***Diagnostic algorithms***

These scripts contain algorithms for assessing likely lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of:
1) Major depressive disorder (MDD)
2) Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
3) Specific phobia
4) Social anxiety disorder/social phobia
5) Panic disorder
6) Agoraphobia

Details on each disorder DSM-5 criteria mapped to questions/responses included in the algorithms can be found within this folder (GLAD_DSM5_diagnostic_algorithms.docx).

***Aim***

Assess the comparability of two commonly used phenotyping methods for depression and anxiety disorders.

## Folder structure
***algorithm_scripts*** - Algorithm scripts to ascertain likely lifetime diagnoses of DSM-5 depression and anxiety disorders

***DIAGCOMP_scripts*** - Cleaning and analyses scripts specific to the Davies et al (in prep) manuscript

***outputs*** - Rmarkdown knits in HTML format for DIAGCOMP results.
