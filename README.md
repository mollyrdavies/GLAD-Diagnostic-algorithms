# GLAD-Diagnostic-algorithms
These scripts contain algorithms for assessing likely lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of:
1) Major depressive disorder (MDD)
2) Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
3) Specific phobia
4) Social anxiety disorder/social phobia
5) Panic disorder
6) Agoraphobia

The scripts utilise data from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, but can be applied to other datasets that include the CIDI and DSM-5 checklist questionnaires.

These algorithms were created for Davies et al (in preparation) "Comparison of algorithm-based versus single-item phenotyping measures of depression and anxiety disorders in the GLAD Study cohort"
